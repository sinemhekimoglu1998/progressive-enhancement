    <h3> The story </h3>
        <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said, <q class="neighbors"> "We are so strong to hear your horse has run away.this is most unfortunate." </q>
            The farmer said,<q class="chinese"> "maybe" </q>The next day the horse came back
            bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<q class="neighbors">"Oh,
            isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now hav eight horses!"</q>The farmer again said,<q class="chinese"> "Maybe." </q> </p>
            <p>  The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
                The neighbors then said,<q class="neighbors">" Oh dear, that's too bad,"</q> and the farmer responded,<q class="chinese"> "Maybe." </q> The next day the conscription
                officers came around to conscript people into the army,
                and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
                Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q class="neighbors">"Isn't that great!"</q> Again, he said,<q class="chinese">"Maybe."</q></p>

            - because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
